<h1><a name="linux">Installation in Linux systems</a></h1>

<h2>The necessary files</h2>

When you are reading this, you must have already downloaded the
following files from the source of bangtex:<br>

<ul> <font color="green">
<li> bfonts.tar.gz
<li> bsty.tar.gz
<li> bsample.tar.gz
</font> </ul>


If you have not, please go back to the source of bangtex by 

<a href="bangtex.html">
clicking here</a>


and download these files. Save them in any directory. For the sake of
definiteness, we will call this directory <dfname>
/BT</dfname>. This can be a directory in a user's area, or in the
system area.

These are all tarred zipped files. You need to unzip them before they
can be used. But first, we need to identify the directory where they
ought to be unzipped.


<h2>Identifying a certain directory</h2>

For this, you need to be the superuser.  (If you do not have access to
the superuser account, you have to go to a <a href=#nonsu>different
section</a>.) Log in as the superuser. Go to the topmost directory
(usually denoted just by a `/') and issue the command

<h4> find -name cmr10.mf </h4>


This will tell you where the file cmr10.mf is located. This is one of
the files in the <font color="magenta">
TeX</font>/<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> distribution system. If
the computer cannot find this file, there is something wrong with the
installation of <font color="magenta">
TeX</font>/<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> in your system. In this
case, forget about installing bangtex and rather
have <font color="magenta"> TeX</font>/<font color="magenta">
LaTeX</font> installed in your computer properly. In the rest, I
assume that this is not the case, and the computer has given you some
reply to the <dfname> find</dfname> command issued
above. Unfortunately, the answer would vary from computer to computer,
depending on the version and distribution of <font color="magenta">
TeX</font>/<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> installed. However, all
answers should have the following generic structure:

<h4> /AAA/texmf/fonts/source/public/cm/cmr10.mf </h4>

where <dfname> /AAA</dfname> is a symbolic representation. This is the
part which varies from one computer to another. For example, on one
computer that I use frequently, <dfname> /AAA</dfname> is
<dfname>/usr/share</dfname>. This means that the answer to the `find'
command on this computer should yield

<h4> /usr/share/texmf/fonts/source/public/cm/cmr10.mf </h4>

But in another computer, the answer could be

<h4> /usr/lib/teTeX/texmf/fonts/source/public/cm/cmr10.mf </h4>

which would mean that <dfname> /AAA</dfname> is <dfname>
/usr/lib/teTeX</dfname> on this computer. Whatever it may be, you need
to remember the name of the <dfname> /AAA</dfname> directory for the
rest of the installation. In everything that follows, replace <dfname>
/AAA</dfname> by the name of the directory that you have just
determined for your computer.


<h2>Installing the font files</h2>

Go to the directory

<dfname> /AAA/texmf/fonts/source</dfname>

by issuing the command

<h4> cd &nbsp; &nbsp;/AAA/texmf/fonts/source </h4>

where <dfname> /AAA</dfname> stands for the directory/subdirectory
determined above. In this directory, copy the file <dfname>
bfonts.tar.gz</dfname> (which was originally stored in the directory
called <dfname> /BT</dfname>) by issuing the command

<h4> cp &nbsp; -p &nbsp;/BT/bfonts.tar.gz &nbsp; &nbsp; . </h4>

(Don't forget the dot at the end!)
And then unpack the contents of the zipped file by giving the command 

<h4> tar xvfz bfonts.tar.gz </h4>

This command will create a subdirectory for keeping the bangla font
files, unpack the font files and keep them there.




<h2>Installing the macro files for <font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font></h2>

<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> needs extra macro files for formatting a document. For a
document written in Bangla, we need to have the macros such that the
headings for chapters, sections, etc appear in Bangla, and so do the
captions for tables and figures. For this, extra files need to be
installed. 

You now need to go to another directory. Issue the command

<h4> cd &nbsp; -p &nbsp;/AAA/texmf/tex/latex </h4>

where, as before, <dfname> /AAA</dfname> is symbolic here.  In this
directory, copy the file <dfname> bsty.tar.gz</dfname> (which was
originally stored in the directory called <dfname> /BT</dfname>) by
issuing the command

<h4> cp &nbsp; -p &nbsp; /BT/bsty.tar.gz . </h4>

And then unpack the contents of the zipped file by giving the command 

<h4> tar xvfz bsty.tar.gz </h4>

This command will create a subdirectory for keeping the bangla font
files, unpack the font files and keep them there.


<h2>If you are updating...</h2>

If this is the first time you are installing bangtex on your computer,
ignore this part and go to the <a href="#lininit">next section</a>. If
you already have an earlier version of bangtex installed, you must
eliminate some files of that earlier version so that the new ones
work.

For this, you need to identify two more directories. Go to the topmost
directory and issue the commands in succession:

<h4> find &nbsp; / &nbsp; -name &nbsp; bang*.tfm<br>
     find &nbsp; / &nbsp; -name &nbsp; bang*.*pk</h4>

Suppose they show you that you have some <dfname> tfm</dfname> files in the
directory <dfname> /TTT</dfname> and some <dfname> pk</dfname> files in the directory <dfname>
PPP</dfname>. Then issue the commands

<h4> rm &nbsp; -f &nbsp; /TTT/bang*.tfm<br> 
rm &nbsp; -f &nbsp; /PPP/bang*.*pk</h4>


Of course the directory names are symbolic, and you need to substitute
the real names in the commands.



<h2><a name="lininit"></a>Initializing the files</h2>

You now have all the files in their proper places. You still have to
pass on this information to the computer. In other words, when the
computer will run <font color="magenta"> TeX</font> or <font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font>, it should know to look for the files
in these locations. This can be done by going to the top directory
through the command

<h4> cd &nbsp; &nbsp;/ </h4>

and issuing the command

<h4> texhash </h4>

You will see the names of a lot of files flashing on the
screen. Finally, when it is done, the installation is complete.

If for some reason, <dfname> texhash</dfname> does not work, you can
instead issue the command

<h4> texconfig </h4>

This will open a window with many options. You can choose the option

<h4> rebuild ls-R database </h4>

with the arrow keys on your keyboard and hit the <dfname>
enter</dfname> key. This has the same effect as the command <dfname>
texhash</dfname>. Once you are done, choose the <dfname> exit</dfname>
option and hit return to exit <dfname> texconfig</dfname> and finish
installation.


<h2><a name="check"></a>Checking the installation</h2>

As we mentioned, all the operations mentioned after the downloading of
the source files must be performed by logging in as the superuser. Now
that the installation is complete, this restriction does not apply any
more. In fact, any user now should be able to use the Bangla fonts.

To know how to do that as well as to check that the installation was
successful, we have provided some sample files in <dfname>
bsample.tar.gz</dfname>, which includes the manual. So, in any
directory where the file <dfname> bsample.tar.gz</dfname> resides,
issue the command

<h4> tar xvfz bsample.tar.gz </h4>

As this unpacks, you will see the names of some files, including one
called <dfname> manual.tex</dfname>. This is a <font color="magenta">
LaTeX</font> file containing the manual. Run <font color="magenta">
LaTeX</font> on it:

<h4> latex manual </h4>

In the process, you will see the computer creating the fonts. It might
give some error messages during this stage. Ignore them. None of them
is serious. 

When it is done, you can see the <dfname> dvi</dfname> file on the
screen or print it out as you would print any file formatted by <font
color="magenta"> LaTeX</font>. This will give you instructions about
how to use the Bangla fonts. See also the other files that came out of
<dfname> bsample.tar.gz</dfname> in order to learn various features of
creating a Bangla document.  Before leaving this page, please read the
sections on the <a href="#psfonts">installation of postscript
fonts</a>, and on some <a href="#advice">advisory remarks</a> which
also appear on this page.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">Top of page</a>



<hr>

<h1><a name="nonsu">Installation for non-superusers in Linux</a></h1>

If you do not have the power of the superuser, you can still use
bangtex, but with some restrictions. The installation in this case is
easier.  You merely download the following files in a directory<br>

<ul> <font color="green">
<li> bfonts.tar.gz
<li> bsty.tar.gz
<li> bsample.tar.gz
</font> </ul>

If you have not done so already, do it now from the source of bangtex by 

<a href="bangtex.html">
clicking here</a>.


We suggest that you keep them in a directory where there are no other
files.  Now unpack them, issuing the command

<h4> tar &nbsp; xvfz &nbsp; b*.tar.gz </h4>

This completes the installation. You can now <a href="#check">check
the installation</a> and try to print out the manual for using
bangtex.  Before leaving this page, please read the sections on the <a
href="#psfonts">installation of postscript fonts</a>, and on some <a
href="#advice">advisory remarks</a> which also appear on this page.

<p> 

Although the installation is much simpler this way, there is a serious
disadvantage of this method. You will be able to use bangtex
<u>only</u> in the directory where you had unpacked the tarred files
mentioned above. You cannot use it even from any other directory in
your own user area.  Needless to say, we recommend that you do not
install bangtex this way unless all possibilities of getting superuser
access fails.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">Top of page</a>





<hr>

<h1><a name="unix">Installation on Unix systems</a></h1>

You need to follow the instructions provided for Linux
systems. The only difference is in unpacking the downloaded files. For
example, when you come to the stage in the installation where you have
to unpack the file <dfname> bfonts.tar.gz</dfname>, issue the series of
commands

<h4> gunzip bfonts.tar.gz<br>
 tar -xvf bfonts.tar</h4>

Keeping this in mind, go to the section on <a href="#linux">Linux
systems</a>.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">Top of page</a>





<hr>

<h1><a name="psfonts">Installation of Postscript fonts</a></h1>

The postscript fonts, as well as the related instruction material, has
been created by <a href="mailto:ananda_samaddar@yahoo.co.uk">Ananda
Kumar Samaddar</a>.  I thank him for allowing me to include this
program in the main bangtex distribution.<p>


The entire package can be downloaded as a single tarred & zipped file
called <font color="green">bpsf.tar.gz</font>. If you have not already
downloaded this file, please go back to the source of bangtex by

<a href="bangtex.html">
clicking here</a>

and download it.  I assume that you have kept it in the directory we
have denoted by <dfname>/BT</dfname>.  Go to that directory and issue
the command

<h4> tar xvfz bpsf.tar.gz </h4>

Once this is done, you will notice that a new subdirectory called
<dfname>bpsf</dfname> has been created under the directory
<dfname>/BT</dfname>.  It should contain 11 files.  Go
through the file called <dfname>README</dfname> first.
That should answer other questions like how the postscript fonts have
to be installed, and why they are useful.  Any question, comment and
appreciation on the installation or use of this program should be sent
directly to the its creator by clicking on his name above.<p>

<h1><a name="seicor">Installation of <i><b>seicor</b></i></a></h1>

This program has been created by <a href="mailto:somen@iopb.res.in">
Somendra Mohan Bhattacharjee</a>.  I thank him for allowing me to
include this program in the main bangtex distribution.<p>

If you have not already downloaded <i><b>seicor</b></i>, I recommend
that you go back to the source of bangtex by

<a href="bangtex.html">

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

In the instructions below, I am assuming that you are using the
<font color="magenta">MikTeX</font> installation of <font color="magenta"> TeX</font> and <font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font>. Though not absolutely
essential, I recommend that you get some familiarity with the program
itself if you do not have it already, without worrying about the
Bangla files or fonts.

Now, to use the Bangla fonts, first make sure that you have already
downloaded the following files from the source of bangtex:<br>

<ul> <font color="green">
<li> bfonts.tar.gz
<li> bsty.tar.gz
<li> bsample.tar.gz
</font> </ul>

If you have not, please go back to the source of bangtex by 

<a href="bangtex.html">
clicking here</a>


and download these files. Save them on your Desktop. Don't be bothered
if they clutter your Desktop. Once the installation is complete, you
can delete them.


<h2>Identifying a certain directory</h2>

In everything that follows in this section, a click should mean
clicking the left button of the mouse. Start by the following clicks:

<p align="center">
<table border=4 padding=3 bgcolor="cyan">
<tr>
<td>Start</td> 
<td>Find </td>
<td>Files or Folders</td></tr></table>
</p>

It means that you start by clicking the <blink>Start</blink> button at
the lower left corner of the screen with the left button of your
mouse. Among the possibilities which open up, choose the
<blink>Find</blink> option, followed by <blink>Files or
Folders</blink> by clicking on them. This kind of abbreviation for
clicks will be used throughout this section.

The clicks described above will open a box where you can put in the
name of a file you want to search. Type the name

<p align="center">
<dfname> cmr10.mf </dfname>
</p>

in that box and ask it to search it in the <font
color="456789">C:</font> directory. Then click the button for
<blink>Find now</blink>.

This will tell you where the file <dfname> cmr10.mf</dfname> is
located. This is one of the files in the <font color="magenta">
TeX</font>/<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> distribution system. If
the computer cannot find this file, there is something wrong with the
installation of <font color="magenta"> TeX</font>/<font
color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> in your system. In this case, forget
about installing bangtex and rather have <font color="magenta">
TeX</font>/<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> installed in your
computer properly. In the rest, I assume that this is not the case,
and the computer has given you some reply to the commands issued
above. The answer might vary from one computer to another, depending
on the version and distribution of <font color="magenta">
TeX</font>/<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> installed. However, all
answers should have a common generic structure, viz., you should see
that the file <dfname>cmr10.mf</dfname> is sitting in a directory whose
name is of the form

<p align="center">
<dfname> AAA\texmf\fonts\source\public\cm </dfname>
</p>

where <dfname>AAA</dfname> is a symbolic representation. This is the
part which varies from one computer to another. For example, on one
computer that I have checked, <dfname>AAA</dfname> is <font
color="456789">C:</font>. This means that the answer to the `find now'
command on this computer gave me the folder name

<p align="center">
<dfname> C:\texmf\fonts\source\public\cm </dfname>
</p>

But in another computer, the answer could be different.  Whatever it
may be, you need to remember the name of the <dfname>
<dfname>AAA</dfname></dfname> directory for the rest of the
installation. In everything that follows, replace <dfname> AAA</dfname>
by the name of the directory that you have just determined for your
computer.



<h2>Installing the font files</h2>

Now go back to your <dfname>Desktop</dfname> and double click on the
file <dfname> bfonts.tar.gz</dfname> that had been sitting there. This
is a zipped file, so the double click will cause <dfname>
WinZip</dfname> to start working. Choose the <dfname> Extract</dfname>
option. It will ask you which folder to extract the file into. In the
box provided for the answer to this question, write

<p align="center">
<dfname> AAA\texmf\fonts\source </dfname>
</p>

Remember that <dfname> <dfname>AAA</dfname></dfname> is symbolic
here. It should be replaced by the appropriate thing, as described
above. If you now click on <dfname> Extract</dfname> again, the fonts
files will be unpacked and placed in proper places.


<h2>Installing the macro files for <font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font></h2>

<font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font> needs extra macro files for formatting a document. For a
document written in Bangla, we need to have the macros such that the
headings for chapters, sections, etc appear in Bangla, and so do the
captions for tables and figures. For this, extra files need to be
installed. 

For this, double click on the file <dfname> bsty.tar.gz</dfname> on
your Desktop and follow exactly the same steps as for installing the
font files, with the exception that you put in the folder name

<p align="center">
<dfname> AAA\texmf\tex\latex </dfname>
</p>

when you are asked for one. Here also, <dfname>AAA</dfname> is
symbolic as before.



<h2>If you are updating...</h2>

If this is the first time you are installing bangtex on your computer,
ignore this and go to the <a href="#wininit">next section</a>. If you
already have an earlier version of bangtex installed, you must
eliminate some files of that earlier version so that the new ones
work.

For this, do 

<p align="center">
<table border=1 bgcolor="cyan">
<tr>
<td>Start</td> 
<td>Find </td>
<td>Files or Folders</td></tr></table>
</p>

once again.  This time, ask the computer to search for the following
file:

<p align="center">
<dfname> bang10.tfm </dfname>
</p>

Again, it will show you the folder where this file is in. For example,
on my computer, it returns with the following folder name:

<p align="center">
<dfname> C:\localtexmf\fonts\tfm\bangla </dfname>
</p>

Start clicking on the <blink>My Computer</blink> widget on your
desktop until you see this folder. Then drag the entire folder to the
<blink>Recycle bin</blink> on your desktop.

Now go one level up in the folder list by clicking the <blink>
Up</blink> symbol on the window. You should see two folders now,
one called <dfname> tfm</dfname> and the other called <dfname>
pk</dfname>. Double click on the <dfname> pk</dfname> folder. You
should see a folder called <dfname> ljfour</dfname>. Double click on
it. There should be a folder called <dfname> Bangla</dfname> sitting
here.  Drag this entire folder to the <blink>Recycle bin</blink>
as well.


<h2><a name="wininit"></a>Initializing the files</h2>

You now have all the files in their proper places. You still have to
pass on this information to the computer. In other words, when the
computer will run <font color="magenta"> TeX</font> or <font color="magenta"> LaTeX</font>, it should know to look for the files
in these locations. This can be done by clicking the following buttons
in succession:

<p align="center">
<table border=1 bgcolor="cyan">
<tr>
<td>Start</td> 
<td>Programs </td>
<td>MikTeX </td>
<td>MikTeX options</td></tr></table>
</p>


This will open a box. It has several pages. Hopefully it will open on
a page titled <dfname> General</dfname>. If not, click on the name of
that page and it will open. You will see different things on this
page. One of them is called <dfname>File Name Database</dfname>. It
should have a button called <blink>Refresh now</blink>. Click on this
button. Wait until the computer does the refreshing. Once it is done,
click on the cross button on the upper right to close the window for
<blink>MikTeX options</blink>.



<h2>Checking the installation</h2>

The installation is now complete. Bangtex is now ready to be used. To
know how to use it as well as to check that the installation was
successful, we have provided some sample files in <dfname>
bsample.tar.gz</dfname>, which includes the manual. It is best first to
try to print the manual out, which will give you further instructions
for creating documents on your own.

For this, double click on the name of the file <dfname>
bsample.tar.gz</dfname> sitting on your Desktop. Store the extracted
files in any folder you want, but it is recommended that you do not
store it in the <dfname> texmf</dfname> or <dfname> localtexmf</dfname>
folders, or any other system folder like <font
color="456789">C:\Windows</font>. For the sake of definiteness, let us
say that you have saved the extracted files on a directory named <font
color="456789">C:\btfiles</font>. If you have chosen some other name
instead, change the ensuing instructions accordingly.

It is now best to go to the <dfname> MS-DOS prompt</dfname> by clicking

<p align="center">
<table border=1 bgcolor="cyan">
<tr>
<td>Start</td> 
<td>Programs </td>
<td>MS-DOS prompt </td>
</tr></table>
</p>

At the prompt, type

<h4> cd &nbsp; &nbsp;C:\btfiles </h4>

Once in the directory, issue the command

<h4> latex manual </h4>

and let the computer do what it wants to do. It will take a while,
because it will have to create all the Bangla fonts. This will happen
only the first time. If you run latex subsequently, it will be much
faster because the fonts will then already be there on the disk.

Once this is done, you can go back to the Windows Desktop and click


<p align="center">
<table border=1 bgcolor="cyan">
<tr>
<td>Start</td> 
<td>Programs </td>
<td> MikTeX </td>
<td> Dvi viewer</td>
</tr></table>
</p>

This will open a window to view the file. Click on the <dfname>
`File'</dfname> option, and then the <dfname> `Open'</dfname>
option. In the window provided, either type in the name of your file,
e.g.,

<p align="center">
<dfname> C:\btfiles\manual </dfname>
</p>

and then click <dfname> `Open'</dfname>, or double click on the folder
name on top successively until you double click your folder and your
file. Now you can see the file as it would appear in print. If you
want, you can print it out. If you have come to this point
successfully, the installation is complete and perfect, and you can
throw away the files <dfname> tar.gz</dfname> files that you had
downloaded.

<h1><a name="mac">Installation on MacOS</a></h1>
<p align=right> (Courtesy: Suratna Das)
<p>
  
It will be assumed that MacTex is installed on your computer.  This is
the basic step for using
<font color="magenta">TeX/LaTeX</font> in MacOS.  The distribution
files for bangtex can be downloaded before you start the procedure
outlined below, or can be downloaded during the installation, as
indicated in these instructions.


<h2> Global installation for all users on a given computer </h2>

You will need superuser privileges for doing this.  Either log in as
superuser, or use <comm>sudo</comm> in front of every command shown
below.

<ol>

  <li> Check whether the folders <dfname>/Library/texmf/tex/latex</dfname>
    and <dfname>/Library/texmf/fonts/source</dfname> exist on your
    computer.  They should.  If not, create them with the
    command <comm>mkdir</comm>. 


<li> 
Download <dfname>bfonts.tar.gz</dfname> and move it to
the <dfname>/Library/texmf/fonts/source</dfname> folder by using the
command

<h4> mv &nbsp; bfonts.tar.gz &nbsp; /Library/texmf/fonts/source/ </h4>

<li> Go to the
  folder <dfname>/Library/texmf/fonts/source</dfname> and untar the
  fonts file by issuing the commands

  <h4> cd /Library/texmf/fonts/source <br>
    tar xvfz bfonts.tar.gz </h4>

  <li> Similarly download bsty.tar.gz, move it to the folder
    <dfname>/Library/texmf/tex/latex</dfname>, go to that folder and
    untar it:

    <h4> cd /Library/texmf/tex/latex <br>
      tar xvfz bsty.tar.gz </h4>

    <li> At this stage, you can delete the
    files <dfname>bsty.tar.gz</dfname>
    and <dfname>bfonts.tar.gz</dfname> if you want.  They will not be
    needed again.

    </ol>

That completes the installation.  To check whether the installation
has been successful, download <dfname>bsample.tar.gz</dfname> in any
folder.  Let us say the name of this folder is <dfname>/SAM</dfname>.
Go to that folder and untar this file:

<h4> cd  /SAM <br>
  tar xvfz bsample.tar.gz </h4>

You will see a few files coming out in the process.
Run <font color="magenta">LaTeX</font> on any one of these sample
files.  The most important one is the manual file, which you should
run <font color="magenta">LaTeX</font> on, and read for preliminary
instructions for using bangtex.

<h2> Installation for a single user </h2>

This kind of installation is not recommended.  But, if you do not have
superuser access and are desperate to install bangtex, you can follow
these steps.


<ol>

  <li> Create two folders <dfname>~/Library/texmf/tex/latex</dfname>
  and <dfname>~/Library/texmf/fonts/source</dfname>.  Note that,
  initially the <dfname> ~/Library</dfname> folder will not have
    the <dfname>texmf</dfname> folder. So you will have to create the
  folder sequentially.  For example, to create the first one, issue
	the commands

	<h4>  cd ~/Library <br>
	  mkdir texmf <br>
	  cd texmf <br>
	  mkdir tex <br>
	  cd tex <br>
	  mkdir latex </h4>

For the other one, the commands are similar, with obvious change of
	some names.

  <li>  Now follow the steps for superuser installation starting from
  step 2, except that anywhere you see the directory
  name <dfname>/Library</dfname>, replace it
  by <dfname>~/Library</dfname>.
    

</ol>

<h1><a name="advice">Words of advice for all systems</a></h1>

Whether you are using the program in Linux or Unix or Windows, the
following remarks may be of help.

<ol>

<li> Latex files with cross references need to be run at least twice
before the cross references are properly displayed. This applies for
the file <dfname> manual.tex</dfname> included in the distribution, and
any file with cross references that you might prepare.  

<li> The
sample file called <dfname> samptex.tex</dfname> has to be run with
plain <font color="magenta"> TeX</font> rather than <font
color="magenta"> LaTeX</font>. All other sample files in the
distribution, including the manual file, are <font color="magenta">
LaTeX</font> files.  

<li> You can look into the sample files to learn
some tricks. For example, if you are preparing a plain <font
color="magenta"> TeX</font> document and don't know how to make the
page numbers appear in Bangla, look into the file <dfname>
samptex.tex</dfname> to find out the solution.
