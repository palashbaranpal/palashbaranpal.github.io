<h3><a name="sample"><font color="#f0ff00">Sample output</font></h3> 

I know you should not be interested in the package unless you see the
output. So click here to view or download a sample page of text (<a
href="samples/samptex.ps">ps</a> / <a
href="samples/samptex.pdf">pdf</a>) or letter (<a
href="samples/samplett.with.ps">ps</a> / <a
href="samples/samplett.with.pdf">pdf</a>).  If, after viewing them,
you are interested in downloading it, read on. The software is free.


<hr>
<h3><a name="dl+inst"><font color="#f0ff00"> Downloading and
installation</font></h3> 

<p>
<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
The basic bangtex files have a total size of about 68 kb in zipped
form. The postscript font package is about 230 kb.  Once you unzip them
(follow the instructions to find out when and where to unzip), they
will take a total of about 500 kb space on your disk. You need that
much free space on your disk to begin with. Then, if you write
documents using the program, they will take disk space according to
the length of the document.

<li> You will have to have Tex/Latex installed on your system. The
Bangla font and style files can run only with their help.

<li> You need to have a working knowledge of Tex/Latex. By "working
knowledge", I mean that you should know how to produce a printout (or
a screen-image) if you have a source file for Tex/Latex. Bits and
pieces of this knowledge should be available from the installation
guidelines, but they are not meant to be complete.

<li> For Unix/Linux systems, you should have the <tt><b> tar</b></tt>
command working in order to unpack the files. For Windows systems, you
should have <tt><b>WinZip</b></tt> for unpacking the files.

</ol>

<p>

<h4>Instructions: </h4>
<ol>
<li> Download the following files and keep them in any directory. I
suggest that you create a separate directory for this purpose so as
not to erase any files with the same names that might exist
in your existing directories. Windows users might choose to keep them
on the Desktop.
<ul>
<li> <a href="bfonts.tar.gz">bfonts.tar.gz</a>
<li> <a href="bsty.tar.gz">bsty.tar.gz</a>
<li> <a href="bsample.tar.gz">bsample.tar.gz</a>
</ul>
<p>

<li> I recommend that you read through the end of this page before
performing the installation.  In particular, read carefully through
the section on "Supporting software".  You might want to download some
of them as well.  Near the bottom of this page, you will find
directions for the installation procedure.<p>

<p>

<li> At the end of the installation procedure, you will find how to
print out a copy of the manual for typesetting in Bangla.

<h3><a name="supp"><font color="#f0ff00">Supporting software
</font></h3> 

Since the time <tt>bangtex</tt> was first introduced, many people have
contributed towards making it better and more user-friendly.  Some of
these contributions come as suggestions which have been implemented
into the basic <tt>bangtex</tt> package.  Some others have created
supporting packages.  While none of these are absolutely essential for
the basic functioning of <tt>bangtex</tt>, they are all recommended
because they make <tt>bangtex</tt> work much better: either the output
or the input.  Here are some of those, with a brief description of
each.

<ol>
<li> The <i><b>bpsf</b></i> package, created by <a
href="mailto:ananda_samaddar@yahoo.co.uk">Ananda Kumar Samaddar</a>.
These are postscript fonts for <tt>bangtex</tt>.  If you want to get a
feel for what it does, see the postscript files created from the same
latex file, with (<a href="samples/samplett.with.ps">ps</a> / <a
href="samples/samplett.with.pdf">pdf</a>) and without (<a
href="samples/samplett.without.ps">ps</a> / <a
href="samples/samplett.without.pdf">pdf</a>) using these fonts.  If
you are convinced of the merits of using the postscript fonts after
seeing these samples, download the file

<ul> 
<li> <a href="support/bpsf.tar.gz">bpsf.tar.gz</a> 
</ul> 

Keep it in the directory where you have kept the earlier files.


<li> The program <i><b>seicor</b></i>, created by Somendra Mohan
Bhattacharjee.  This is a unix/linux shell program which allows you to
write the input file with much less effort.  If you have used
<tt>bangtex</tt> before, you will appreciate the advantage of using
this file by looking at the instruction page for <a
href="support/readme_sei.pdf">seicor</a>.  This is a pdf file. <p>

If you have never used <tt>bangtex</tt> before, probably it is
difficult to explain the advantage gained by using
<i><b>seicor</b></i>.  Roughly speaking, it makes typing of Bangla
text faster and easier.  In Bangla, some of the vowel signs go to the
left of the associated consonant.  For example, if you want to write
"pen", the order of the characters appearing in Bangla type is "epn".
But if you type it in the latter form, it is hard to recognize the
word as "pen" on the screen.  Normal <tt>bangtex</tt> provides a
solution whereby you can typeset it as "\*p*en".  If you use
<i><b>seicor</b></i>, you can typeset this word as "pen" in your input
tex file, run <i><b>seicor</b></i> on it, and the output contains
"\*p*en".  Then you run LaTeX on the resulting file.<p>

It is recommended that you download <i><b>seicor</b></i>:

<ul> 
<li> <a href="support/seicor">seicor program </a> 
<li> <a href="support/readme_sei.pdf">seicor instructions</a> 
</ul> 

Keep it in the directory where you have kept the earlier files.

<li> The program <i><b>mkbangtex</b></i>, created by Koushik Ray.  It
is also a preprocessor for bangtex.  In other words, writing
bangla would be much simpler if you use this program.  You create a
file using mkbangtex rules (which are simpler than usual bangtex), run
mkbangtex on the file, and your output is a bangtex file with the
usual bangtex symbols and syntax.

<p>

Like in seicor, you will not need to use the bangtex \* commands for
i-kar, e-kar etc.  In addition, you do not have to use many of the
capitalizations which are needed in bangtex.  For example, "ataeb",
after running mkbangtex, turns to "AtoEb", which is usual bangtex.

<p>

<li> A front-end for bangtex created by
  <a href="mailto:takdoom@gmail.com">Abhijit Dasgupta</a>.  
It enables one to type directly in Bangla, using any Unicode
text-editor and font.  Of course, the TeX/LateX commands will have to
use ASCII characters, but whenever you want to type Bangla text, you
can directly see it on the screen, without any processing of the file.
The details can be found
by <a href="http://dasgupab.faculty.udmercy.edu/uni2bangtex/index.html">
clicking here</a>.

<li> A software for unicode conversion from bangtex,
  called <i><b>sei2uni</i></b>, developed by Proyag Pal and Palash
  Baran Pal.  It is a perl program.  It operates on a bangtex file
  written in the almost-phonetic form by using the \* commands, or the
  seicor version in which the \* commands are suppressed.  The output
  is a unicode file for everything except commands and formatting
  statements.

<h3><a name="update"><font color="#f0ff00">Updating information
</font></h3> 

<h4> April 2001 update </h4>
<ol>
<li> Original release had only the class file <tt>bbook.cls</tt>,
suitable for books. This release has, in addition,
<tt>barticle.cls</tt> and <tt>bletter.cls</tt>, suitable for articles
and letters, respectively. A new sample file has also been added to
illustrate the use of the bletter class.

<li> The <tt>bbook.cls</tt> class file did not have the sectioning
commands properly. The <tt>\chapter</tt> command was okay, but the
commands for <tt>\section, \subsection</tt> etc were not. It has been
fixed in the present update.

<li> Some typesetting exceptions, mainly regarding <i>na-fala</i>, have
been made regular. See manual for details.
</ol>

<h4> January 2002 update </h4>
<ol>
<li> Now <tt>bangtex</tt> is Windows compatible. The instructions for
downloading in Windows have been added.
<li> Nothing has changed for a Unix/Linux user except that in a very
few cases, the shape of some letters have been changed a bit in order
to make the fonts Windows compatible. The changes are imperceptible
for all practical purposes.
</ol>

<h4> December 2002 update </h4>
<ol>
<li> Bangla can now be used in the math mode.
<li> The manual is bigger now, containing instructions for the math
mode, and some other frequently asked questions on earlier versions.
<li> Shapes of a few characters changed. The changes will be
imperceptible to the eye.  But, with these changes, it is easier to
create fonts of arbitrary size.
</ol>


<h4> March 2003 update </h4>
<ol>
<li> Bangtex now comes with postscript fonts.  These fonts have been
created by <a href="mailto:ananda_samaddar@yahoo.co.uk">Ananda Kumar
Samaddar</a>.  All the credits should go to him, and I thank him for
allowing me to include these fonts in the main bangtex distribution.
Any question, comment and appreciation on these fonts should be sent
to him directly by clicking on his name above.
</ol>


<h4> August 2003 update </h4>
<ol>
<li> A new set of fonts introduced.  These are hollow  fonts, or
outline fonts, i.e., the output will contain only the outline of a
charater.  The inside will be hollow.

<li> Some shortcuts introduced in typesetting. For example,
<tt>NG/g</tt> can now also be typeset simply as <tt>n/g</tt>.
Similarly, <tt>NG/k</tt> as <tt>n/k</tt>, <tt>NJ/c</tt> as
<tt>n/c</tt>, <tt>NJ/j</tt> as <tt>n/j</tt> etc.  The manual gives 
details. 
</ol>


<h4> December 2005 update </h4>
<ol>

<li> The program <i><b>seicor</b></i> introduced.  It has been created
by <a href="mailto:somen@iopb.res.in"> Somendra Mohan
Bhattacharjee</a>.  All the credits should go to him, and I thank him
for allowing me to include this program in the main bangtex
distribution.  Any question, comment and appreciation on the program
should be sent to him directly by clicking on his name above.

</ol>


<h4> April 2008 update </h4>
<ul>

<li> The program <i><b>mkbangtex</b></i> linked.  It has been created
by <a href="mailto:koushik@iacs.res.in"> Koushik Ray</a> some time
ago, and he deserves all credits for it.  Any question, comment and
appreciation on the program should be sent to him directly by clicking
on his name above.


</ul>



<h4> July 2009 update </h4>
<ul>

<li> The file <i>banglig.mf</i> changed so that the conjunct 
<tt>j+jh</tt> can be obtained by typing <tt>j/jh</tt>.  If you already 
have <i>bangtex</i> installed on your computer and want only to change 
<i>banglig.mf</i> with its new version, <a href="changed/banglig.mf">click 
here.</a>  Save the file in the same location where you had a file 
with the same 
name.  Then you need to erase all files of type <i>bang*tfm</i> and 
<i>bang*pk</i> in order the changes can take effect.  The tfm and pk 
files will be automatically recreated by your computer when you will use 
<i>bangtex</i> next time.


</ul>


<h4> October 2010 update </h4>
<ul>

<li> Link made to an unicode editor for bangtex. It has been created
  by <a href="mailto:takdoom@gmail.com">Abhijit Dasgupta</a>, and he deserves all credits for it.  Any question, comment and
appreciation on the program should be sent to him directly by clicking
on his name above.

</ul>



<h4> February 2021 update </h4>
<ul>

  <li> Link made to a perl program that converts bangtex files to
  unicode Bangla.  It has been created by Proyag Pal and Palash Baran
  Pal.  Link to this software is given above.
