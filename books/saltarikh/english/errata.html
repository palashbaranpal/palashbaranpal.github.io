  <h1> Journey through time </h1>

  <h2> by Palash Baran Pal (translated from
    the Bengali by Sushan Konar) <br>
    Scholastic, 2008.  ISBN: 978-81-7655-970-6

  </h2>

  <h2> Corrections, modifications, etc </h2>

  <font size=+1>

The translated book was published in a hurry, and there are many
printing errors.  Here is a list.  It is recommended that the reader
corrects them in the book before starting to read the book, at least
the ones which have been marked as <b> serious error</b>.

<p>

In listing the suggestions, I have used the page number of the printed
version.  On each page, Paragraph 1 means the paragraph that contains the first
line of the page, whether or not it has been carried over from the previous
page.  Section headings have not been counted while counting line
numbers.  For an erratum involving a multi-line section, usually the
first line is mentioned in the table.

<p>

the rule might be.  To illustrate that, it would be enough to recall how long
it took for the Gregorian reforms to be accepted. </td>
